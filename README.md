# The semiotics of emotion expression 

# Project description

With the proliferation of digital technology, computer-mediated communication (CMC) has become an integral part of human interactions in many parts of the world. Nonverbal behavior is widely considered to be one of the crucial elements ensuring effective interpersonal communication and, therefore, attracts considerable interest in the CMC area, where various nonverbal behaviors are not available. There is a growing body of research on textual paralinguistic cues (TPC) present in written CMC; however, there has been little discussion on this topic in the Swiss context. The aim of this master project was thus to examine the patterns of use of the TPC in the WhatsApp messages in the Swiss national languages, based on the What’s up Switzerland (WUS) corpus. 

This master project was carried out under the supervision of Prof. Ekaterina Velmezova and Prof. Aris Xanthos from the University of Lausanne (UNIL).
The What’s up Switzerland (WUS) corpus was provided through the courtesy of Professor Elizabeth Stark from the University of Zurich.
